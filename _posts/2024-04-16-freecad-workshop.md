Constraint-based and parametric modelling is ideal for prototyping something, as it is straightforward to modify your design without having to partially 
re-model it. Rather than drawing your geometry at a fixed position and with a fixed scale and orientation, constraint-based modelling allows you to add 
bits of geometry (e.g. line segments, circular arcs, ...) and specify properties — constraints — such as length, angle or distance in a flexible way. In
addition, you can assign labels to values, which can be used to define properties of other bits of geometry (e.g. define a circular arc with the same length as
a line segment elsewhere).

The open source and cross-platform FreeCAD nowadays offers an impressive environment for the above. Although the initial learning curve might be somewhat
steep (simply because it's a different design paradigm), you'll quickly get used to it.

In this workshop, we'll introduce the main tools of 2D sketching in FreeCAD, and subsequently use these sketches to model 2.5D and 3D objects. The first part 
will consists of multiple live demos, followed by the opportunity to model something yourself (e.g. using an existing technical drawing).

**Date and time**: Tuesday 23 April 2024 at 19:30

**Location**: Starship Factory, Building K-102, Klybeckstrasse 141, 4057 Basel ([route](https://starship-factory.ch/anfahrt/))

**Requirements**: Please install FreeCAD (version 0.21 or later) on your laptop **before** the workshop and check to see if it starts properly! We won't have time to troubleshoot individual installations...

**Costs**: None, though there is always the option to donate (see also [here](https://starship-factory.ch/spenden/))

**Registration**: Not necessary, simply drop by (though please be on time)
