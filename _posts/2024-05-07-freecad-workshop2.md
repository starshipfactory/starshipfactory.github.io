Following the workshop on constraint-based/parametric modelling in FreeCAD, let's take a look at CAM (i.e. computer-aided manufacturing) in FreeCAD! We'll start with some theory on 3-axis CNC milling, covering

* Different types of milling bits
* Chipload
* RPM
* Feedrate
* Depth of cut
* Conventional versus climb cutting


Next, we'll check out some options in the Path workbench in FreeCAD, focusing on operations to generate different kinds of tool paths like

* Contours
* Pockets
* Holes


In addition, we'll look at several modifications of these paths, including 

* Ramp entries
* Tags
* Dogbones 


If time permits, we'll run a full example project on the CNC router in the Werkstatt.
